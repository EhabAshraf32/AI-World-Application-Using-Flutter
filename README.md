## Benfit👻
## 1-Sentiment Analysis:
Implemented a Sentiment Analysis module that analyzes the sentiment of given textand provides insightful visualizations in the form of flow charts. By utilizing NLP models, the applicationdetermines whether the text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. Additionally, the application employsthe Awesome Dialog package to present captivating visualizations of the sentiment ratios, indicating whetherthe text is positive, negative, or neutral.
## 2-Neural Network
: Integrated a Neural Network module that predicts the content of landscape photos. Userscan input landscape images, and the application utilizes CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models to predictthe objects or scenes present in the photos. This feature enhances user experience by automatically analyzingand labeling the contents of landscape images.
## 3-Machine Learning for Restaurant Reviews
: Developed a Machine Learning module specifically designed foranalyzing restaurant reviews. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the application predicts whether agiven review is positive or negative, indicating the sentiment associated with the review. This functionalityallows users to gain insights into the overall sentiment of the reviews and make informed decisions about theirrestaurant choices.
